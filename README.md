This program will convert dropped .obj (wavefront) files onto it, into .mdl (warcraft 3) and put them in the same folder as the source.

Notice:
1. no matter how much objects you had in your obj file, the outcome will be a single geoset 
2. do not mess with the .obj file with notepad or similar.

Bonus to converted mdl file:
- origin ref
- geoset attached to bone "base", and using material
- material with layer using texture "Textures\white.blp"

Requires .net 3.5.

Single .exe file.
