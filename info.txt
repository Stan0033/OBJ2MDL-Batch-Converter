description
obj is one of the simplest human-readable formats for storing a 3d model's geometry (no animations or bones) and is supported by a long list of 3d modelling apps.

Drop .obj files onto the app, and will spit out MDL file on the same location. 

- Single .exe file
- Requires .NET 3.5 (Windows XP SP2 and later)

Notice:
- Does not modify the scaling or rotation. Do this post-conversion.
- if geosets have a bone each, each bone's pivot point is not calculated, it's 0,0,0. You might want to change that post-conversion.
- Does not recalculate normals after triangulation. They  might look weird if the obj model contained quads or ngons. So recalculate the normals with programs like mdlvis, post-conversion.
- extents can be recalculated post-conversion

Bonus to converted MDL file:
- origin ref
- Stand and Death sequences
- material/s using texture "Textures\white.blp"

How to test:
